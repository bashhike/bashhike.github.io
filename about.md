Hi, I'm Abhishek. 

I work as a Research Engineer at American Express, building intelligent applications using NLP. This blog is an attempt to pen down the random things (read issues) that I encounter while trying make things work, in hope that they might be helpful to someone else as well. <br>
You might find occasional philosophical rant, I can't help myself sometimes. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

If you'd like to chat, feel free to reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/bashhike_) or drop an email at bashhike[at]gmail[dot]com.
