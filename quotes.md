A collection of quotes that I find to be helpful, maybe inspiring at times. 

- "You need to start doing something that people want. You don't need to join a company to do that. All a company is a group of people doing something that people want. It's doing something that people want that matters, not joining a group."  [[https://paulgraham.com]](https://paulgraham.com)

- "All great writing is rewriting."  [Many great writers apparently]

- "If you haven't tried something enough to fully appreciate its worth, if you haven't conquered a challenge, you are not in a position to claim that the challenge is not worth your effort and time. Once it's overcome, it is your right to denounce it, to say it was a waste. But until then, you're merely avoiding it because it frightens you, or that you worry that you simply can't do it. And on that point, you're wrong." [[https://drawabox.com/]](https://drawabox.com/article/ink)
